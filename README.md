The two Jupyter notebooks, IntroToPython_VariablesConstantsAndLists and IntroductionToPython_PandasNumpyScipyMatplotlib, are intended to help in the teaching of an introductory course in scientific programming in Python for engineering students, especially junior or senior undergraduate students and fresh graduate students. The two csv files cned_anndata.csv and wunderground_2020-05-25_2021-05-25.csv are needed, as are the images catConEdSpreadSheet_Annotated.png and catConEdSpreadSheet.png. All other csv files are created in the course of running the cells in the Jupyter notebooks. Happy learning!
